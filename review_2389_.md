# A beautiful review

## i Interest of content

The written content is interesting, but there's no images, etc. to give you a break from the text

## ii Consistency and Quality of Representation

The articles presentation is mostly consistent, with a few exceptions (some pages have a "Back to top" button, and some
do not) - However, the styling of the index/homepage is completely different from the article pages in terms of layout
and typeface.

## iii Quality of Written Presentation

the work is very well written and shows competency in the research field.

## vi Validity of HTML

All looks valid, you've got the doctype, the language, the header etc.
The only thing I would change is to move your style into a stylesheet rather than a style tag.

## v Evidence of Collaboration

Visible - blame shows that you did do the crediting on each other's pages. 
The blame also says suggests you didn't do it last minute so well done.
